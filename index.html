            <p>Communities are usually built on shared struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the
                goals of each community differ per the individual's collective needs.Over the years, these developer
                communities have grown across the world with different goals and missions but still with the general aim
                of providing a platform for developers to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow.</p>

            <p id="para-1">Although mobile apps are successfully used for managing chronic diseases [3,4], the ongoing
                COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the need for mobile app solutions at the forefront to reduce the risk of
                cross-contamination caused by close contact [5-7]. Mobile technology has been leveraged in a number of
                ways to control the spread of COVID-19. Mobile apps are accessible, acceptable, and easily adopted, and
                have the ability to support social distancing efforts. As such, they have been widely developed and
                implemented during the previous months in an attempt to “flatten the curve” of the increasing number of
                COVID-19 cases, providing knowledge and information to civilians while attempting to relieve the
                pressure from health care systems.
